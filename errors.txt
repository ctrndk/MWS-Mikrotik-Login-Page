# This file contains error messages which are shown to user, when http/https
# login is used.

#	$(error-orig)	- original error message from hotspot
#	$(ip)		- ip address of a client
#	$(username)	- username of client trying to log in

# internal-error
# It should never happen. If it will, error page will be shown
# displaying this error message (error-orig will describe what has happened)

# config-error
# Should never happen if hotspot is configured properly.

config-error = configuration error ($(error-orig))

# not-logged-in
# Will happen, if status or logout page is requested by user,
# which actually is not logged in

# IP address for user is to be assigned from ip pool, but there are no more
# addresses in that pool
